# Jam Track Data
This repository has code that generates and displays Jam Track data, primarily on how many songs there are per artist in FNFestival and the number of songs per genre.

## New:
I have added a file that displays all the songs with difficulty 5 or 6 in their respective instruments.

## How does it work?
The list of all available jam tracks can be found on the public Fortnite Content API at [this link](https://fortnitecontent-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/content/api/pages/fortnite-game/spark-tracks).

## Other Information
I am considering either making a web app or an executable that can pull up all this data and display it more nicely. If there are any other suggestions, please reach out to me.
