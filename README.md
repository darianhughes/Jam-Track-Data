# Jam Track Data
This respository has code that generates and displays Jam Track data, primarily how many songs there are per artist in FNFestival and the ammount of songs per genre.

## How does it work?
The list of all available jam tracks can be found on the public Fortnite Content API at [this link](https://fortnitecontent-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/content/api/pages/fortnite-game/spark-tracks).
