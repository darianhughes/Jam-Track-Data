# Jam Track Data
This repository has code that generates and displays Jam Track data, primarily on how many songs there are per artist in FNFestival and the number of songs per genre.

## New:
Added a list of songs.

I added the functionality to view what songs are new this week.

## Changes:
Popular and XO Tour Lif3e is no longer always detected as a new song.

songs_per_artist.txt now shows the percentage of the total songs for an artist's songs in Fortnite Festival.

## How does it work?
The list of all available jam tracks can be found on the public Fortnite Content API at [this link](https://fortnitecontent-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/content/api/pages/fortnite-game/spark-tracks).

I update the files every time Jam Tracks are added to the API.

## Other Information
I am considering either making a web app or an executable that can pull up all this data and display it more nicely. If there are any other suggestions, please reach out to me.
